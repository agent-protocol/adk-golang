### 🛠️ Key Components

1. **A2A Server** (`server/main.go`)
   - Exposes local agents as remote services
   - Multiple agent types (Calculator, Weather, Greeter, Multi-tool)
   - Standard endpoints (health, discovery, agents list)
   - JSON-RPC over HTTP protocol

2. **A2A Client** (`client/main.go`)  
   - Agent discovery and metadata retrieval
   - Basic and streaming message sending
   - Task lifecycle management
   - Error handling and timeouts
   - Comprehensive usage patterns

3. **Full Demo** (`full_demo/main.go`)
   - Integrated server + client in one program
   - Multiple demo scenarios
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Real-world usage patterns

4. **Development Tools**
   - Makefile with common commands
   - Automated test suite
   - API reference guide
   - Development server with auto-reload

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Separate Server & Client

Terminal 1 - Start server:
```bash
cd examples/a2a
make server
```

Terminal 2 - Run client:
```bash
cd examples/a2a  
make client
```

### Option 2: Integrated Demo

```bash
cd examples/a2a
make demo
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing

```bash
# Build everything
make test

# Start server
./build/a2a-server &

# Test with curl
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/agent.json

# Run client
./build/a2a-client

# Clean up
pkill a2a-server
```

## 📊 What the Examples Demonstrate

### Core A2A Features
- ✅ Agent discovery via well-known endpoints
- ✅ JSON-RPC communication protocol  
- ✅ Task creation and management
- ✅ Streaming responses with Server-Sent Events
- ✅ Error handling and timeouts
- ✅ Multiple agent types and capabilities
- ✅ Tool integration with agents
- ✅ Concurrent request handling

### Advanced Patterns
- ✅ Agent metadata and capability discovery
- ✅ Task lifecycle management (create, query, cancel)
- ✅ Push notification configuration
- ✅ Custom HTTP headers and authentication
- ✅ Multi-step task execution
- ✅ Background task processing
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### Production Considerations
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Request/response logging
- ✅ Resource cleanup
- ✅ Timeout management
- ✅ Concurrent safety

## 🔧 Available Agents

The server example includes 4 different agents:

1. **Assistant** (`assistant`)
   - General-purpose agent with all tools
   - Calculator, weather, and greeting capabilities
   - Streaming support

2. **Math Specialist** (`math_specialist`)  
   - Focused on mathematical calculations
   - Advanced calculator functionality
   - Mathematical problem solving

3. **Weather Specialist** (`weather_specialist`)
   - Weather information and forecasts
   - Location-based weather data
   - Mock weather API integration

4. **Greeter** (`greeter`)
   - Simple greeting functionality
   - Welcome messages and introductions
   - Basic conversational agent

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /a2a` | Main A2A JSON-RPC endpoint |
| `GET /.well-known/agent.json` | Agent discovery |
| `GET /health` | Health monitoring |
| `GET /agents` | List available agents |

## 📋 JSON-RPC Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tasks/send` | Send message and create task |
| `tasks/sendSubscribe` | Send message with streaming |
| `tasks/get` | Query task status |
| `tasks/cancel` | Cancel running task |
| `tasks/pushNotification/set` | Configure push notifications |
| `tasks/pushNotification/get` | Get push notification config |

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
./test.sh
```

The test suite validates:
- ✅ Dependency availability (Go, curl)
- ✅ Build success for all examples
- ✅ HTTP endpoint functionality
- ✅ Agent discovery process
- ✅ A2A protocol communication
- ✅ Task creation and management
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Development Mode**:
   ```bash
   make dev-server  # Auto-restart on changes
   ```

2. **Quick Testing**:
   ```bash
   make quick-test  # Automated integration test
   ```

3. **API Exploration**:
   ```bash
   make endpoints   # Show available endpoints
   ```

4. **Dependency Check**:
   ```bash
   make deps        # Check required tools
   ```

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start with the README.md** - Understand the concepts
2. **Run the full demo** - See everything working together
3. **Study the server example** - Learn how to expose agents
4. **Explore the client example** - Understand how to consume agents
5. **Read the API reference** - Master the protocol details
6. **Run the test suite** - Validate your setup
7. **Experiment with modifications** - Build your own agents

## 🛡️ Production Readiness

These examples include production considerations:

### Security
- Authentication header support
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message sanitization
- Resource limits and timeouts

### Monitoring  
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

### Scalability
- Concurrent request handling
- Resource cleanup
- Memory management
- Connection pooling

### Reliability
- Graceful shutdown
- Error recovery
- Timeout handling
- Circuit breaker patterns

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can now:

1. **Extend the examples** with your own agents and tools
2. **Deploy to production** using the patterns shown
3. **Integrate with other systems** via the A2A protocol
4. **Build agent networks** with multiple interconnected agents
5. **Add monitoring and observability** to track agent performance
6. **Implement authentication and authorization** for secure communication

The examples provide a solid foundation for building real-world agent-to-agent communication systems using the Go ADK.
